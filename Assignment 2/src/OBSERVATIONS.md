# Observations

## Pass-by
- Primitives (like int) go by value → method gets a copy → original not changed.
- Objects: ref goes by value → still points to same object → fields can change.

## Static
- `static` var is shared by all objects.
- Can use by class name (better) or by object (also works).

## Constants
- `final` = cannot change value.
- `static final` = one constant shared by all.
